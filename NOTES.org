#+title: Notes

Remove controller go with a more morphic inspired design.  With a world object
that manages interactions and morphs that decorate entities with whatever
information the frontend needs. Use morphs on the frontend as well starting
with primitives that reify and generalize the facilities of the canvas. Maybe
make use of websockets to enable bidirectional data flow.
